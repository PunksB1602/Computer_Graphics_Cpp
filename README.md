## Computer Graphics Lab (4th Semester, 2023/24)

This repository contains a set of C++ programs developed as part of my Computer Graphics laboratory in the 4th semester (2023/24). The primary aim of these programs is to provide hands-on experience with fundamental computer graphics algorithms and 2D geometric transformations, utilizing the graphics.h library.

### Overview

The programs in this collection cover:

- **Line Drawing Algorithms:**
	- DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer)
	- BLA (Bresenham's Line Algorithm)
- **Circle and Ellipse Drawing:**
	- Midpoint Circle Algorithm
	- Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm
- **2D Transformations:**
	- Translation
	- Scaling
	- Rotation
	- Reflection
	- Shearing
- **Polygon and Shape Manipulation:**
	- Applying transformations to rectangles, triangles, and general polygons
- **Interactive Menus:**
	- Programs that accept user input for transformation parameters and display graphical results
